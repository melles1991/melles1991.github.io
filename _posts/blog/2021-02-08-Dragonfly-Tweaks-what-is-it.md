{% include alerts/warning.html content="Optimization or acceleration of the device must be approached in a comprehensive manner, I described a universal method by following which you are guaranteed to speed up your smartphone or tablet: this will affect both the FPS in games and the speed of application launch. Any optimization requires a smart approach as you can get both positive and negative results." %}

I support the open source project MoKee (hereafter MoKee) for Redmi 7 (hereafter R7), as well as Chidori kernels for R7. 
For a long time I was engaged in kernel optimization and in every possible way bypassed any programs for optimization, until recently.

Recently, the Dragonfly Project caught my eye. Or rather, one from their Dragonfly Tweaks creations. 
This is a strong auto-optimizer of the device, with the possibility of manual adjustment. 
I liked the Intellectual settings profile, this profile automatically balances the work of the processor and the graphics core depending on the needs of the device and at the same time tries to work on the minimum number of cores, in my case 4 s 8. 
The peculiarity of this profile is that when the device is in sleep mode, the battery consumption is reduced to the maximum minimum, while maintaining high performance after waking up.

In the near future, I plan to supplement the review with examples of linear settings and not only, but now I advise everyone who has become interested to look at the project website or in the tg group for details.
