The main advantage of Android, in my opinion, is the variety of possibilities for both customization and smartphone control.  
In general, I do not have so many programs in the device's memory, but there are those that I have been using for a very long time.

[Total Commander](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghisler.android.TotalCommander)|The Android version of the file manager of the same name for Windows, with a set of similar advantages from its version for desktop operating systems.
[Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2)|An easy-to-use file manager that allows you to conveniently work with files both on a mobile device and on an SD card. After that, you will not want to use any other similar Android application. (I use it more often than Total Commander)
[ZArchiver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver)|The program allows you to work with archive files of the following formats: 7z (7zip), zip, bzip2 (bz2), gzip (gz), XZ, tar.  Plus, the program can unpack the following types of archives: 7z, zip, rar, bzip2, gzip, XZ, iso, tar, arj, cab, lzh, lha, lzma, xar, tgz, tbz, Z, deb, rpm, zipx, mtz.
