Google held a big presentation of the new Android 12 operating system today at the Google I / O conference.

The new OS brings a big design change. Google introduced a new design language Material Design called Material You, which redefines the interface throughout the system.

Google emphasizes that Android 12 has become "the biggest design change in recent years." Especially noted is the automatic creation of a new color scheme when changing the wallpaper, the first to receive this function is Google Pixel smartphones.

Quick Settings have been redesigned, including the addition of the Google Pay icon and smart home controls.

We paid special attention to safety. The system now has a Privacy Dashboard - a panel where you can see what permissions applications received, and when it happened.
