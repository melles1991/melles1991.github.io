## Hi guys

A lot of interesting things have happened in the community over the past months. So I won't put it off and get down to the top news right away.

### New Craft Rom Manager!

During these half a year, the application has come a long way and has become overgrown with functionality, as well as a huge amount of unnecessary garbage. I had 2 ways of development, leave it as it is or start everything from scratch. 
It was difficult to decide on this, but even so I decided to write an application practically from scratch. The base would be highlighted and stable functionality transferred to it.
As for the future, I will return everything that was but in a more perfect form, and also add more useful things.

### Podcasts and news on the site

I have been thinking about the development of the project for a long time. Not long ago, I got the idea to create podcasts and write useful articles or articles. So, in the near future, podcasts will appear in the tegram chat and on the site.

#### Moderators Telegram chat

As you already read in the title, we have appointed the first moderator in the Telegram chat. The fighter is young, so please do not offend, as he can punish)))).

I was finally able to build a stable kernel for Poco X3. The kernel is under development and may change many times in terms of optimization. Thanks to all the testers who took part in the testing.
