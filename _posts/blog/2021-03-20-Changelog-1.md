## Hello

Not so long ago I started to knock down the kernel and firmware for [Redmi 7](https://www.craft-rom.ml/devices/onclite/) and now it's time to develop and move forward. 
This post will be the beginning of the development of Craft Rom as a project.

### New Craft Rom Manager!

Our official app is currently in active development.
Its main task is the news feed of the site, as well as updating kernels and firmware within our project.
In the near future we will release and describe in detail its functionality.

### Expansion of the staff

In connection with the above, it was decided to look for like-minded people and expand the number of administrators.
Meet the new members of Carft Rom.
